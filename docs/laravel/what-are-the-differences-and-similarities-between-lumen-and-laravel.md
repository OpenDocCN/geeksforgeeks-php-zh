在深入研究之前，你必须知道那些东西是什么，所以 **Lumen** 是微服务， **Laravel** 是全栈框架。

**Lumen:** 它是由 Taylor Otwell 创建的一个微框架，Lumen 是一个更轻、更瘦、更小、更快的完整 web 应用框架。Lumen 框架比 Laravel 更快更轻，它有一个庞大的社区。它只有较少的配置和不同的参数。
**Laravel:** 它是 Taylor Otwell 在 2011 年创建的一个 web 应用框架，和所有其他现代框架一样，它也遵循 Model-View-Controller (MVC)架构模式。Laravel 重视优雅、简单和可读性，如果说用 PHP 框架构建应用程序，Laravel 是首屈一指的。

**Laravel 和 Lumen 的相似之处:**

| 拉维尔 | 流明 |
| Laravel is licensed under the license of MIT. | Lumen also got permission from MIT. |
| Laravel uses its own grammar. | Lumen uses the syntax of laravels, which can be easily upgraded to Laravel. |
| Third-party tools supported by Laravel. | Lumen also supports third-party tools, but in a small number. |
| Laravel was developed by Taylor Ottwell. | Lumen was also developed by Taylor Ottwell. |

**Laravel 和 Lumen 的区别:**

<figure class="table">

| 拉维尔 | 流明 |
| Laravel has a good document to handle and start a new project. | Lumha has no clear documentation, but it is easier to use than Laravel. |
| Laravel is a full-stack web application framework based on MVC, which supports **spatie** **trust** **socialize** and many other third-party tools and frameworks. | Lumen is a micro-framework, which is used to develop microservices and APIs with fast development speed and less time. |
| Compared with Lumen, Laravel's SQL query performance is very good. It can be easily removed from the application level | Turning to the database, Lumen rejected SQL queries that could not be executed on the database, which was weaker than Laravel. |
| 拉腊瓦·维琴蒂剩下的 API。 | Lumen is more suitable for building high-performance micro-framework API. |
| Laravel can handle event queuing and has powerful templates. | Lumen can't handle event queuing and doesn't have any powerful templates. |
| Laravel has a Symfony framework, which can be used to create Symfony components. | Lumen has no Symfony framework, so it is impossible to create Symfony components. |
| Laravel has its own command line interface. | Lumen is a microframe with rich features. |

**结论:**Laravel 和 Lumen 在现代移动网络应用中都表现良好。Laravel 更可取，因为它的社区很大，如果你想创建 RESTfull APIs，Laravel 更有效。
